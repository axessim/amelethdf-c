Compilation and installation:
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

This project requires:
  * Scons cross-platform builder
  * Reasonably conformant C compiler:
    GCC 4.6 - Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 [Express] 32 or 64
  * HDF5 Libraries [HEADERS and LIBRARIES] in version 1.8.3.  
    (see http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html)

Basic installation
------------------

These are generic installation instructions.

The 'scons' script attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent
variables used during compilation. Use help command for more details
'--help'. It uses those values to create a valid compilation rulls. It may also
create one or more '.h' files containing system-dependent definitions.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type 'scons' to
 configure and compile the package for your system.

Installation names
''''''''''''''''''

By default, 'scons' will install the package's files in current directory
'$PWD/bin', '$PWD/man', etc. You can specify an installation prefix other than
'/usr/local' by giving 'scons' the option '--prefix=$PATH'.

 scons --prefix=$PATH

Build flavor
''''''''''''

The build flavor is used to define the kind of compilation 'release', 'debug' or
'assert' corresponding to different compiler options. You can specify the flavor
build by giving 'scons' the options '--flavor=$FLAVOR'.

 scons --prefix=$PREFIX --flavor=$FLAVOR

Build type and targets
''''''''''''''''''''''

The targets are used to choose the package's component it can be: library, tools
and tests.

 scons install 
 scons install_lib
 scons install_tests
 soncs install_tools


Build directory and temporal data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All temporal data are stored in 'tmp/$flavor' directory or can be define by
'scons' option '--build-dir'.

 scons --build-dir=/tmp


Optional Features
-----------------

Some packages pay attention to '--enable-FEATURE' options to `scons', where
FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package. They may also pay attention
to '--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE is something like 'libz' or 'mpich'
(for the paralle compilation).  The `README' should mention any `--enable-' and
`--with-' options that the package recognizes.

For packages that use some PACKAGE, 'scons' can usually find the PACKAGE include
and library files automatically, but if it doesn't, you can use the 'scons'
options `--PACKAGE-includes=DIR' and `--PACKAGE-libraries=DIR' to specify their
locations.
