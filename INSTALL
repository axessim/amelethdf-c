Compilation and installation:
=============================

Dependency
----------

The only dependency is HDF5 in version 1.8.3.
(see http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html)


Compilation
-----------

cmake is used to compile Amelet-HDF tools.

Just tape the following commands :

cd somewhere
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake path/to/amelet-hdf/directory
> There must be a CMakeLists.txt file in this directory.
> IMPORTANT : Answer the questions about HDF5.

make
make install

All executable are in ./bin.


Alternative way:

cd somewhere
mkdir build
cd build
cmake PATH/TO/SRC \
      -DHDF5_DIR:STRING=PATH/TO/HDF5/share/cmake/hdf5 \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING=PATH/TO/INSTALL/DIR \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=[DEBUG|MINSIZEREL|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO] \
      -DAH5_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=[T|F] \
      -DAH5_BUILD_TESTING:BOOL=[T|F]
make
make test
make install

All executable are in PATH/TO/INSTALL/DIR.
